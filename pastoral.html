            <h3>THE RELIGIOUS / SPIRITUAL FORMATION PROGRAM</h3><br>       
            <p><b>School Pastoral Care Program</b></p> <br>
            <p><b><i>Christian Life Formation Program</i></b></p> 
            <br>
                <ol>
                    <li><b><i>Faithfulness to Catholic Tradition.</i></b> Don Bosco
                        School is a Catholic School run by the Diocese of Baguio. It was put up for human development and as an instrument of Church's evangelization. Part of the school's culture is its religious environment and atmosphere. The Curriculum is integrated with Catholic Tradition. All who come and join the school community will find the religious activities and
                        programs of primordial importance in the school system.</li>
                    <li><b><i>Holiness of Life.</i></b> A Bosconian embraces life of holiness, a disposition Don Bosco wants of every young person Holiness is thus reflected in th student's good manner of speaking, disciplined behavior and in one's way of dealing with other inside and outside of school campus. The campus is expected to be free of bad/foul words, evil actions and
                        sinful deeds. Students are helped to have a personal
                        relationship with the Lord Jesus, thus, they are trained
                        to be prayerful, to love the Word of God and be
                        attentive participative in religious activities.</li>
                    <li><b><i>Holy Mass.</i></b> As articulated in the School hymn, there are sources of strength of a Bosconian, two of these are the Holy Mass or frequent Holy Communion and Confession. A Bosconian comes to school early he/she could attend the Holy Mass at the Parish
                        Church at 6:30 AM. <br> The following are Holy Masses schedule per grade level to attend: <br>
                        Monday - Grade 10 <br> Tuesday - Grade 9 <br> Wednesday - Grade 8/Community <br> Thursday - Elementary <br> Friday - Grade 7
                    </li>
                    <li><b><i>Frequent Reception of Holy Communion, Visit to the System Blessed Sacrament and the Church.</b></i>    A Bosconia
                        renders the Church House of God and gate of Heaves (Domus Dei et Porta Caeli), a Holy Place of Prayer. A Bosconian will always show reverence upon entrance
                        into the Church and observes silence. </li>
                    <li><b><i>Confession.</i></b> Confession is an occasion for
                        reconciliation with the Lord, self-purification, spirital renewal and source of spiritual strength. A Bosconia goes to a regular confession and knows by heart the process of confession.</li>
                    <li><b><i>Church Ministries.</i></b> The students are members of the Parish Community. They are to exercise freely ministries which they can fully participate and be active. There are Church Ministries that will fit students that will make them members of the Parish Youth Ministry.</li>
                   </ol>
            <br>
            <p><b><i>Parental Accompanyment Program</i></b></p>
            <br>
                <ol>
                    <li><b><i>Shepherding Ministry as Class Adviser</i></b><br>
                        Every class is a family. It is therefore given a Class Adviser to accompany the class the whole school year. The Class Adviser will take the place of a parent for these children while in school. The disposition in the spirit of Don Bosco's Preventive System will be that of a loving, caring and compassionate strong father or mother to his/her children.</li>
                    <li><b><i>Refarmatory Program</i></b></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The school believes that a student is new in this worl and is beginning to encounter the world with all beauty and imperfections.</li>
                            <li> The nature of guidance and direction. There are times when the fail. In the Preventive System, failure is a way perfection and an avenue to learn more about life. </li>
                            <li>The Reformatory Director is therefore task in the spirit of shepherding to do all sorts of reformator activities which starts with DIALOGUE with the student who went against the school standards and values or who has gone against Oratory's principle of clos
                                the "doing anything but not to sin. (PS}" 4) </li>
                            <li>Dialogue in the Reformatory Program mean through the guidance of the Reformatory Director the student understands the "bad" face of what he/sh did, realizes the negative impact of the "not good" ac in relation to the standards of the school, and suggest atonement activities as acts of justice and expressions of the student's contrition and desire to be better person for the whole community.</li>

                            <li>Young people have their experiences in life. But the

                                need elders who are full of wisdom to make them understand what is happened and what is happening in them. The avenue for such is the Spiritual Direction Counselling Program</li>
                            <li>Students who are facing confusions and disturbances in family, studies or young life are encouraged to go for
                                SD or IC.</li>
